# MutliTaxiEnv

The environment implemented in [MultiTaxiEnv](https://github.com/sarah-keren/multi_taxi/blob/main/MultiTaxiLabProject.pdf).
Allows for __easy to set up__ Planning and MARL experiments.
Main features:
1. Can control the rewards table.
2. Can switch between symbolic imaged observations.
3. Can apply constraints in the shape of passengers' and fuel's capacity.

For example of use - skim through the [demonstration notebook](https://github.com/sarah-keren/multi_taxi/blob/main/MultiTaxiEnvDemo.ipynb).

Simply installable via:
```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/sarah-keren/multi_taxi"
```

Code originated from [repo](https://github.com/ofirAbu/MultiTaxiLib), by Ofir Abu during joint work involving MARL Resilience. Feel free to give a star in the original repo if you find the project useful :)
